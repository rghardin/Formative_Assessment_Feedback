This streamlit app is designed to interface with the TAMU AI chat to provide comments to formative assessment question responses exported from canvas as a csv file. The instructor provides the API key for the TAMU AI chat, uploads text files with the problem and solution, and uploades the csv file exported from Canvas quizzes. The program creates a csv file with comments for each student that can be uploaded to Canvas, using a Tampermonkey script for importing comments.
